# Setting up your programming environment

All required software can be run on windows/mac/linux.<br>The driver station and Pheonix Framework can only be run on windows. If you really want, you can try to run them with WINE on linux, although this is not recommended.

## Required Software
* [WPILib VSCode](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)
    * Follow the on screen prompts.
    * If you need any help, don't be afraid to ask the code team lead.
* [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/)
    * Git is required to clone, checkout, commit and push changes to the robot code to github. 

## Optional Software
* [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
    * A standalone git client. Not required as git is built in to VSCode.

* [FRC Driver Station/Roborio imaging tool](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station.html)
