# Third Party Libraries
Some motor controllers or sensors require third party libraries to use. For example, the `VictorSPX` motor controller is a part of the Pheonix software. In order to use it, you must install the Pheonix Framework, which can be found on the [setup page](../setup.md).

## Enabling the Pheonix Library
1. Open WPILib VSCode
2. Click the WPILib icon in the top right corner.
